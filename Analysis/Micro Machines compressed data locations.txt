!!!Stage 1

Tiles are loaded based on the number in $db97, which holds the course/vehicle type:

||!Value ||!Type ||
|| 00||Desk/sportscars ||
|| 01||Breakfast table/four by four ||
|| 02||Bathtub/powerboats ||
|| 03||Sandpit/turbo wheels ||
|| 04||Pool table/formula one ||
|| 05||Garage/warriors ||
|| 06||Bedroom/tanks ||
|| 07||Bonus stage/rufftrux ||

This is loaded from a table at $766a, which holds some other info:
- Per-type track indices, usually in the range 0-2 but sometimes 3
- Car parameters - acceleration, top speed, deceleration, steering speed. This is stored per-track but is always the same for the same vehicle.

!!!Stage 2

A table at 

Data decompressed to $cc7c. First four bytes seem to be a header which is never used.
The data lengths vary per track.

!!!Stage 3

Data decompressed to $c7fc. First four bytes again seem to be a header. 
The data length for this part is exacty half that of stage 2 (after ignoring the headers). For the largest tracks, this overwrites the first four bytes from stage 2.

!!!Stage 3
The previous data was all per-track-type. This last part is the only part that varies per track: data is decompressed to
$c000..$c7ff. This overwrites the first four bytes from Stage 3 above.

!!Metatiles

Metatlle tile data is looked up by:

1. Get the metatile number. This is in the range $00..$3f.
2. Convert it to a global metatile index using a table at $da20.
   - This comes from a table at $4225, with 64 bytes per track type.
3. Get a pointer from a split table at $4000 (low byte) and $4041 (high byte) using this global index. For example, index 0 -> $8080
4. This points at the tile indices in a
